# Readme on the type of information 

PowerSetPointmW: command send to laser
LaserDisplaymW: laser power displayed (what laser says he is doing)
PowerMeterMeanW: the real laser power, mesured after the BS by the PowerMeter. A mean over 100 values is computed. 
PowerMeterStdW: the associated standard deviation of the 100 values measured by the PowerMeter. 

KeithleyMeanV: mesures the voltage on the PD. It is a monitor.  A mean over 100 values is computed. 
KeithleyStdV: the associated standard deviation of the 100 values measured by the Keithley.
